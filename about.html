<article class="up"><h1>About</h1>
<p>Here I'm just going to go off about who I am</p><br>
<p>HELLO! My name is Astraeus, or Astraeus_o7, and I am a small online content creator. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to make and post content online.
    Growing up watching people like the Vanoss Crew, Smii7y, Mithzan, and so many more, it was always so appealing to make videos with friends and post them for other
    peoples entertainment. I'm happy to say, a little over 10 years later, I am now acting on this dream and posting online!
</p> <br>
<p>I like to stream and record art and games, although I'm not as active as I would like due to school and work. Although it would be nice to make money off of posting content, my only goal with this
is to hopefully make some people laugh while having fun with friends.
</p><br>
<p>I will add more here as I start posting and growing more</p>
